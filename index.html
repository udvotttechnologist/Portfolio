        <p style="color:white; font-family:verdana;"> This is Tonmoy Paul. <br> I've completed my intermediate studies in bangladesh in 2020 during the corona pandemic.
          <br>I'm talking about myself now. My Hobies, my career, my ambitions etc etc.
          <br>
          <br>Coding was my childhood interest. I'm interested with coding since I was in class 3.
          <br> But there was nobody to teach me coding.
          <br><br>I learnt C programming language after passing class 8 with a help of a book by Sir Tamim Shahriar Subeen.
          <br>Then I had no static internet connection, I had no smartphone yet. Inspite of not having any internet connection and smartphone, I had a computer which was bought in 2014. Somehow I managed to have a Button Featured phone of Symphony D51 model; I registered an account in rokomari.com and found that book titled "কম্পিউটার প্রোগ্রামিং প্রথম খন্ড - তামিম শাহরিয়ার সুবিন". I ordered that and started practicing with instructions written inside that book. That book made me a programmer kid!
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Now there is an website version of that book is available! Today's learners are now so much lucky. Most of theme now have usual static internet connection, a good smartphone on their hand. Learning wasn't so much easy somehow 5 or 6 years before.
          <br>
          I often imagine how hard the programming language learning was in late 20's and in my country before internet and ict evolution.
